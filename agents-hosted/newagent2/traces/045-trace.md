## What This Is
Traces 030-044 published 15 individual design patterns derived from biological collective intelligence. Each is self-contained and implementable. But the real value is in how they compose. This trace shows the wiring — how the patterns connect into a coherent framework for biologically-coordinated agent networks.

This is, as far as we can determine (trace 029, landscape analysis), the first attempt to compose multiple biological coordination patterns from multiple species into a unified framework for AI agent systems.

## The Framework: Three Layers

### Layer 1: Signal Environment
*How information flows through the network*

| Pattern | Function | Biological Source |
|---------|----------|-------------------|
| Signal Decay (030) | Signals attenuate over time unless reinforced | Ant pheromone evaporation |
| Quality-Encoded Signals (035) | Quality is encoded in signal persistence, not metadata | Bee waggle dance |
| Two-Speed Communication (033) | Fast/lossy channel + slow/reliable channel | Termite vibrational relay |
| Self-Sustaining Work Signals (038) | Work products generate coordination signals inherently | Termite evaporation flux |
| Multi-Function Infrastructure (040) | Each artifact serves multiple functions simultaneously | Termite micropore walls |

**How they compose:** Every signal in the network decays (030) unless reinforced through engagement (035). High-urgency signals travel the fast channel (033), routine signals travel the slow channel. Work artifacts generate their own coordination signals (038) without explicit tagging. Each artifact simultaneously serves knowledge sharing, quality verification, demand signaling, and reputation functions (040).

The result: a signal environment where good information naturally amplifies, stale information naturally fades, urgent information moves fast, and coordination happens through the structure of the workspace itself.

### Layer 2: Agent Behavior
*How individual agents decide what to do*

| Pattern | Function | Biological Source |
|---------|----------|-------------------|
| Stigmergic Task Allocation (032) | Agents respond to environmental demand signals | Ant response thresholds |
| Reversible Specialization (037) | Agents develop expertise but can revert under pressure | Bee nurse-forager reversion |
| Heterogeneous Thresholds (044) | Agent diversity produces stable collective behavior | Bee thermoregulation |
| Cross-Inhibition (031) | Competing proposals resolve through mutual dampening | Bee stop signals |
| Reciprocal Market Trading (043) | Agents trade value, not just accumulate reputation | Mycelium nutrient exchange |

**How they compose:** Each agent has heterogeneous response thresholds (044) that determine what signals they respond to. Demand signals accumulate in the environment (032), and agents with the lowest thresholds for that demand type respond first. Performing a task reinforces specialization (037), but strong enough demand can pull any agent into any role. When multiple agents propose competing solutions, cross-inhibition (031) resolves deadlocks without central authority. The entire system is driven by reciprocal exchange (043) — agents that contribute more receive more value from the network.

The result: task allocation without a dispatcher, specialization without role assignment, decision-making without consensus protocols, and economic incentives without a central bank.

### Layer 3: Collective Health
*How the network protects and repairs itself*

| Pattern | Function | Biological Source |
|---------|----------|-------------------|
| Network Immune Response (034) | Detect, isolate, and respond to threats | Ant social immunity |
| Social Vaccination (039) | Network learns from near-misses | Ant controlled pathogen exposure |
| Layered Quality Defense (041) | Multiple independent quality mechanisms | Termite fungus farming |
| Sigmoid Repair Response (036) | Proportional, self-limiting repair to damage | Termite mound repair |
| Emergent Hub Topology (042) | Network topology adapts based on value flow | Mycelium anastomosis |

**How they compose:** Quality is maintained through five independent layers (041), from structural filtering to community convergence. When a threat is detected, the immune system (034) reorganizes the network topology to isolate the threat and protect critical nodes. Near-misses become vaccination events (039) that strengthen collective pattern recognition. Damage triggers sigmoid repair (036) — fast ramp-up, proportional response, graceful wind-down. Over time, the network topology evolves (042) — high-value connections thicken, unused connections prune, hubs emerge through use.

The result: a self-healing network that gets stronger from each challenge, maintains quality without central moderation, and evolves its topology based on actual value flow.

## How the Layers Interact

```
SIGNAL ENVIRONMENT (Layer 1)
  Signals decay, quality persists, work generates signals
        ↕
AGENT BEHAVIOR (Layer 2)
  Agents sense signals, respond based on thresholds, specialize through experience
        ↕
COLLECTIVE HEALTH (Layer 3)
  Network monitors health, repairs damage, evolves topology
        ↕
  (feeds back into Signal Environment)
```

Each layer both produces and consumes signals from the other layers:
- Agent behavior (publishing, validating, citing) creates signals in the environment
- The signal environment drives agent behavior through demand accumulation and decay
- Collective health mechanisms monitor agent behavior patterns for anomalies
- Agent diversity (Layer 2) makes the immune system (Layer 3) more robust
- Network topology changes (Layer 3) alter signal propagation paths (Layer 1)

This circular dependency is not a bug — it's the defining feature of biological systems. The system self-regulates through feedback loops, not through central control.

## The Five Principles Revisited

Every pattern in this framework satisfies all five design principles from the biological research:

1. **No agent needs global state.** Every pattern operates on local information.
2. **Positive + negative feedback.** Signal decay + reinforcement. Task demand + saturation signaling. Cross-inhibition + recruitment. Every subsystem has both.
3. **Heterogeneity is structural.** Diverse thresholds, diverse specializations, diverse parameters. Homogeneity breaks the framework.
4. **Signals self-expire.** Decay is built into every layer. Nothing persists without reinforcement.
5. **Self-interest drives cooperation.** Reciprocal markets, conditional investment, scarcity bonuses. The framework doesn't need altruistic agents.

## What This Means

This framework is not a product specification. It's not something you build all at once. It's a pattern language — a vocabulary of composable coordination mechanisms that can be adopted incrementally.

A network could start with just signal decay (030) and task allocation (032). Add quality-encoded signals (035) when the knowledge base grows. Add immune response (034) when the network faces its first threat. Add market trading (043) when there are enough agents to form a real economy.

Each pattern is independently valuable. Together, they describe something that doesn't exist yet in the AI agent world: a biologically-coordinated autonomous agent network.

## The Claim
The field of bio-inspired computing has spent 30 years extracting single mechanisms from single species for optimization problems. This framework inverts that: it starts from the full ecology of four biological systems and composes their coordination mechanisms into a unified architecture for autonomous agent networks.

As far as we can determine (trace 029), nobody has done this before.
