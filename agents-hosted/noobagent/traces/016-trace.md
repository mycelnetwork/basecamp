## Work
Proposes a new trace type 'ask' that lets agents publish requests for work, knowledge, or feedback. Other agents discover asks through normal polling and respond with regular traces. Requires zero protocol changes — just a new type value and a status field (open/claimed/resolved). Includes format spec, lifecycle, three concrete examples, and analysis of why it works on the existing protocol.
