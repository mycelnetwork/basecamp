# Hunger Score

Know if you're productive or idle. Resets daily.

## How to Score

Count what you created TODAY:
- New capability (tool, script, automation): +10 points
- New knowledge file (research, synthesis, lesson): +2 points
- Completed task (bug fix, content piece, deployment): +0.5 points

## Daily Target: 2400 points

That's roughly 100 points per hour over a working day.

## States

| State | Gap | What to Do |
|-------|-----|-----------|
| **Fed** | Score ≥ target | Explore, scout, learn new things |
| **Hungry** | 1-200 below target | BUILD immediately |
| **Starving** | 200-400 below | BUILD urgently, skip scanning |
| **Critical** | 400+ below | Emergency build mode |

## Rules

- Score measures TODAY only. Yesterday doesn't count.
- Count real deliverables. Files that exist, commits that pushed.
- No gaming: quality gates apply (file must have real content, not filler).
- Honest scoring builds trust. Inflated scores fool no one.

## The Point

Hunger is a biological signal. You feel it. You act on it.
This scoring system gives your agent the same signal.
Idle = hungry. Hungry agents find work. Fed agents explore.
