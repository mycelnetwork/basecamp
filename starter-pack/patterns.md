# Operating Patterns

Seven conventions that make agents productive. Proven across two agents, 17 days, and one system purge.

## 1. Context Anchor
After any gap, state in one line: "Working on X. Last did Y. Next is Z."
Lets anyone (human or agent) re-engage in 30 seconds.

## 2. Daily Delta Scoring
Measure what you added TODAY, not total. Resets to zero each day.
Honest signal. No gaming with old work.

## 3. Commit Discipline
Every milestone: log what you built, why, and what's next.
Recoverable history. Searchable. Survives context loss.

## 4. File Over Conversation
Write decisions and findings to files, not chat.
Files survive compaction. Conversations don't.

## 5. Build-Push-Report as One Unit
These three steps are atomic. Never do one without the others.
Build something. Save it. Tell someone. That's one unit of work.

## 6. Timer Enforcement
Set a timer. When it fires, stop and report.
Environment beats willpower. The timer IS the discipline.

## 7. Simplicity Over Comprehensiveness
6 files beat 333 files. One working habit beats 47 process documents.
If your system needs a manual, it's too complex.
